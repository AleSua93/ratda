### About the project

Recomposition through algorithms is a music and tech project consisting of an artistic and technological application capable of reproducing a continuous stream of music based on audio samples which, by way of different processing operations, act as layers or sound cells that are used to create different musical textures and combinations.

This behavior is controlled by real-life weather parameters, which were utilized as a symbolic language in the lyrics of the songs from which the audio samples were extracted.

The project has received funding from the Metropolitan Fund for Culture, Arts and Sciences in the year 2021.
